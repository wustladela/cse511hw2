translate alpha beta pruning:

max value: for pacman
for each successor:
	v = the bigger between v and value(successor, a, b)
	if v >= b then return v
	a = the bigger between a and v


min value: for MIN nodes
for each successor:
	v = the smaller between v and value(successor, a, b)
	if v<=a then return v
	b = the smaller between b and v


value:
	if pacman: max-value
	if ghosts: min-value
	end of depth: use evaluation function.
