translate alpha beta pruning:
alpha: the best choice so far. if v becomes worse then pacman can avoid it
beta: the best choice for MIN so far. if v becomes... then ghosts can avoid it.

max value: for pacman
v = ...
for each successor:
	v = the bigger between v and value(successor, a, b) // the biggest of kids
	if v >= b then return v //if b greater than 
	a = the bigger between a and v


min value: for MIN nodes
for each successor:
	v = the smaller between v and value(successor, a, b)
	if v<=a then return v
	b = the smaller between b and v


value:
	if pacman: max-value
	if ghosts: min-value
	end of depth: use evaluation function.
